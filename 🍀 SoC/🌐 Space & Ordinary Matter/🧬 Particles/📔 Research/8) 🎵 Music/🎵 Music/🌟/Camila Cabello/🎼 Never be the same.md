# 7. Lyric

#L7

Something must've gone wrong in my brain  
Got your chemicals all in my veins  
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain

Let go on the wheel, it's the bullet lane  
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight  
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine  
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need  
All I need  
Yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe  
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe  
And I could try to run, but it would be useless  
You're to blame  
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same

It's you, babe  
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe  
And I could try to run, but it would be useless  
You're to blame  
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never, ever, ever be the same

I'll never be the same  
I'll never be the same  
I'll never be the same

Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low  
Off of one touch, I could overdose  
You said, "Stop playing it safe, girl"  
"I wanna see you lose control"

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine  
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need  
All I need  
Yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe  
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe  
And I could try to run, but it would be useless  
You're to blame  
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same

It's you, babe  
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe  
And I could try to run, but it would be useless  
You're to blame  
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never, ever, ever be the same

I'll never be the same  
I'll never be the same  
I'll never be the same

You're in my blood  
You're in my veins  
You're in my head (I blame)  
You're in my blood  
You're in my veins  
You're in my head (I'm sayin')

I'm saying it's you, babe  
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe  
And I could try to run, but it would be useless  
You're to blame (you're to blame)  
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same

It's you, babe  
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe  
And I could try to run, but it would be useless  
You're to blame  
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never, ever, ever be the same
