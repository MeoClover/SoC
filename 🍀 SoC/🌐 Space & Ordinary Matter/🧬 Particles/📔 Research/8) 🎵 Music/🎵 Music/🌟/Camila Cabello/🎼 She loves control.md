# 7. Lyric

#L2

Cold, 'cause she has been here before  
She doesn't cry anymore, no looking back  
No, she doesn't go to the bar  
Too many lovers she scarred  
And they want her back

She loves control, she wants it her way  
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up  
She loves control, she wants it her way  
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up

Bold, you know she lives for the thrill  
You know she lusts for the kill  
So they won't come back  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no 

Don't, don't you try taming the storm  
Don't say you haven't been warned  
'Cause she won't like that, like that

'Cause she loves control, she wants it her way  
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up  
She loves control, she wants it her way  
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up

She loves control  
She loves control

Say what you want  
But the way she kills you, makes you feel alive  
And you know that it feels right

She loves control, she wants it her way  
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up  
She loves control, she wants it her way  
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up

She loves control  
She loves, she loves  
She loves, she loves  
You know that she loves it, she can't live without it, no  
Control, hey
