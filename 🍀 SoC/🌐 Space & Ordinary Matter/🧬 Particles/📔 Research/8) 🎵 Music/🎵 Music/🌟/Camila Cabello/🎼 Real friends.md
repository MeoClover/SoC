# 7. Lyric

No, I think I'll stay in tonight  
Skip the conversations and the, oh, I'm fine's  
No, I'm no stranger to surprise  
This paper town has let me down too many times  

Why do I even try?  
Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, nevermind  
Why all the switching sides?  
Where do I draw the line?  
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

I'm just lookin' for some real friends  
All they ever do is let me down  
Every time I let somebody in  
Then I find out what they're all about  
I'm just lookin' for some real friends  
Wonder where they're all hidin' out  
I'm just lookin' for some real friends  
Gotta get up out of this town (Oh, ooh)

I stay up, talkin' to the moon (Ooh)  
Been feelin' so alone in every crowded room  
Can't help but feel like something's wrong, yeah  
'Cause the place I'm livin' in  
Just doesn't feel like home

I'm just lookin' for some real friends  
All they ever do is let me down  
Every time I let somebody in  
Then I find out what they're all about  
I'm just lookin' for some real friends  
Wonder where they're all hidin' out  
I'm just lookin' for some real friends  
Gotta get up out of this town

Lookin' for some real friends

I just wanna talk about nothin'  
With somebody that means something  
Spell the names of all our dreams and demons  
For the times that I don't understand  
Tell me what's the point of a moon like this  
When I'm alone again?  
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful  
Where nobody knows my name?

I'm just lookin' for some real friends  
All they ever do is let me down  
Then, I let somebody in  
But I find out what they're all about  
I'm just lookin' for some real friends  
All they ever do is let me down  
I'm just lookin' for some real friends  
Gotta get up out of this town, yeah
