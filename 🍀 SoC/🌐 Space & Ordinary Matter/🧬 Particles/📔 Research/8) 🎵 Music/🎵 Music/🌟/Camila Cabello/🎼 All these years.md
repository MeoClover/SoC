# 7. Lyric

#L2

Your hair's grown a little longer  
Your arms look a little stronger  
Your eyes just as I remember  
Your smile's just a little softer

And I, and I never prepared for a moment like that  
Yeah, in a second it came all back, it all came back

'Cause after all these years  
I still feel everything when you are near  
And it was just a quick hello  
And you had to go  
And you probably will never know  
You're still the one I'm after all these years

Couldn't help but overhear you  
Sounds like you're happy with her  
But does she kiss you like I kissed you?  
Ooh, I wish I loved you like I miss you

And I, and I never prepared for a moment like that  
Yeah, in a second it came all back, it all came back

'Cause after all these years  
I still feel everything when you are near  
And it was just a quick hello  
And you had to go  
And you probably will never know  
You're still the one I'm after all these years, oh  
'Cause after all these years  
I still feel everything when you are near  
And it was just a quick hello  
And you had to go  
And you probably will never know  
You're still the one I'm after all these years

I never told you, I should've told you  
I never told you after all these years  
I never told you after all these years
