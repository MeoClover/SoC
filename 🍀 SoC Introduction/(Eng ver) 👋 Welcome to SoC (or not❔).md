# THE INTRODUCTION

Before stepping into my universe (opening SoC folder), please look through this note. 

First of all, I truly don't feel a bit grateful to the ones who come here today. So, {hasta la vista}! :))) ðŸ‘‹

...

Assuming that you stay, allow me to start by saying a few words about me: **Meo Clover**. (I don't use the word "self-introducing" because that's what I hate, see my hate list at [[Words I Hate]]).

*Who is Meo Clover? Who writes this note? Who is the master of SoC? Why I need to read this one? Bla bla and bla bla...* ðŸ¤”

This note is the door to my world. It is just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see. I cannot show you all about me neither in this note nor in this Obsidian. However; through this one, the most important trait of me shall be revealed and portrayed:

==**I AM ENIGMA.**==

If SoC is a subject to be learned, Meo Clover is a book to be read, then Enigma will be its initial lesson, its first page to be approached.

Opening the folder SoC, you might find a range of strange folders with strange titles, which makes you extremely confused and feel like you are in a labyrinth. *Why does everything have to be so complicated? Why not giving intelligible names? Why using a lot of metaphor and metonymy? What is the purpose of this mess? Am I standing on a crazy land of a crazy man? Is the author of this place delusional?...* Please always be aware of these things:

This is not your house.
This is not a place to rest after an entire day staying outside with weariness.
This is not a place to search for simplicity or entertainment.

Then? 

This is my house.
This is a place to dig very deep to hunt for treasures.
This is a place to search for complication, and wisdom, soul.

This is a place to get inside of me, my real me, to know me better. :)))

This is a place for people who loved me, love me, and will love me.

Thus, in case that this place cannot meet your needs, you get lost and don't know where you are, please get out of my ground right now and {be my strangers}.

Otherwise, be my guests, take my hand, and I can show you the world, my universe: **SoC**.
